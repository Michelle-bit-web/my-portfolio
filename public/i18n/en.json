    "description": "Hi everyone, I'm Michelle – and a big fan of coding. You might know the quote from a crime series that says programmers are both the detective and the criminal. That perfectly captures my fascination: programming isn’t just about solving problems, it’s a thrilling investigation that challenges you and helps you grow.  I love how each project pushes me forward and opens the door to new Technologies - also as a team. If you're looking for someone who brings heart, curiosity, and a sharp mind to the table, I’d love to work together!"
